<p>Two special cases of linear equations are worth noting.  First, an equation such as <m>y=4</m> can be thought of as an equation in two variables,  
	<me>0x+y=4</me>
For each value of <m>x</m>, this equation assigns the value <m>/alert{4}</m> to <m>y</m>.  Thus, any ordered pair of the form <m>(x,4)</m> is a solution of the equation.  For example, 
	<me>(-1,\alert{4}),~~(2, \alert{4}),~~\text{and}~~(4, \alert{4})</me>
are all solutions of the equation.  If we draw a straight line through these points, we obtain the horizontal line shown at left below.</p>
